### Introduction

[PollyNet](http://polly.rsd.tropos.de/?p=about) is a global atmospheric lidar network which consists of different versions of polly lidar systems. The network is constructed by [lidar group](https://www.tropos.de/institut/abteilungen/fernerkundung-atmosphaerischer-prozesse-neu/) in [TROPOS](https://www.tropos.de/)(Leibniz-Institut für
Troposphärenforschung e.V.). The high temporal and spatial resolved measurements enrich our understanding of aerosol distribution, transportation and aerosol-cloud interaction. During the past 2 decades, countless efforts are put into the update of polly systems in the world. And we also received continued support from other internation groups. As the expand of the whole network, a higher demand of automatic processing chain is at table. How to deliver the physical phenomena behind the lidar data in a realtime and friendly way is of great challenge for our processing algorithm. Armed with the accumulated experience and knowledge, we believe this will be a new start and opportunity to show our muscles and make us prepared for the 20 years.
